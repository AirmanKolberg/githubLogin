# githubLogin
Often times I'm working on a side project, and I'd like to do a quick login to GitHub to post what I've got.  So, here's a quick script I've created, that you could of course copy for your own, to simplify (and expedite) the process of logging into GitHub.  Also, in case all of my drives and machines fail, I'll have these nice, simple scripts saved here hopefully.

If, for any reason, you would like to donate- though unneccesary, is always apreciated!

Thank you all for reading!
